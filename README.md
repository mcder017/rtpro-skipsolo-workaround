Microgate RTPro programs presume there can be multiple athletes on the track at the same time.  
For sports where that is not true, and especially when training with limited coaching and timing staff for those sports, 
it is frustrating to have to go to the timer and click through and cancel extra start and extra stop events that occur 
when athletes step through the timing beam during discussion with coaches or when entering the track.  A Skip:Solo
mode on the timer that would automatically reject 2nd start events before a finish, or 2nd stop events before another start,
would be very helpful.  

As a partial workaround, the 2nd start event can be annulled via the serial interface on the RTPro.
2nd stop events are automatically skipped in the Training program, but can NOT be automatically annulled
in the Single Start program because the user interface on the RTPro blocks, waiting for a bib confirmation.
So this project is a partial workaround.  And better solved with a software change for the Skip mode options in the RTPro.
